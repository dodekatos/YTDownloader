# YTDownloader

Download video and audio from websites using YTDLP via a simple popup.  
The popup interacts with a native client to run YTDLP and serve other functions.

The addon also includes a simple video and audio re-encoding tool that makes use of FFmpeg.

I'll add more source code and a link to the addon when it's released.
